# About Me

Hi there, I'm Atishaya (Everyone calls me Atish). Welcome to my personal website's repository.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in Joint Honours Computer Science & Mathematics with a minor in Statistics at the University of Manitoba.

I love tackling hard problems that nobody else wants to keep working. My current research interests are all things combinatorics, graph theory (Especially spectral graph theory), Hypergraph Neural Networks, and NP Hardness proofs for geometrical problems.

Professionally, I work with LG Electronics US as a senior frontend developer for their B2B platform. While academically, I work with 2 computer science labs: The GADA lab and the Terrabyte research group. Additionally, I am working on a combinatorics paper with Dr. Mahsa N. Shirazi and Dr. Andrii Armann all at the University of Manitoba.
